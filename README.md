## ðŸš€ About Me

My name is Arthur, IÂ´m from Brazil and i have 20 yo. 
I started programming when I was 17 years old, and since then I have dreamed of making the world a better place through one of my passions, which is technology. IÂ´m graduating with Computer Science degree (expected to finish in 2025), and worked as a Jr. Support Analyst at @AlterdataSoftware (2022-2023).         
One of my main goals is to work aboard and be able to build a better world doing what I love.
